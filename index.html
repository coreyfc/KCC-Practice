The mountain peaks of Tongariro, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu were a gift from Ngati Tuwharetoa in 1887. 
This was 15 years after the worlds first national park, Yellowstone was created in the United States.<p></div>
	<div class ="content_4"> <h2>National parks are palces set aside to protect natural landscapes and native plants and animals forever.
They are really big - 10,000 hectares or more. Protection comes first but they are also places for people to enjoy. GO visit some 
of them (just don't damage them), We also have underwater national parks - they are called marine reserves!</h2></div>
